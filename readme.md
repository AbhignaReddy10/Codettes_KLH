🥗 BiteConnect AI
Precision Operations for Zero-Waste Kitchens

BiteConnect is an AI-driven logistics ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between commercial food production and social redistribution. By leveraging a Hybrid AI approach, we optimize the three critical pillars of food management: Predictive Prep, Raw Material Integrity, and Social Impact.

🚀 The Three Pillars
1. Precision Prep (Prediction)
Using Facebook Prophet, we analyze historical sales data to identify seasonality, trends, and patterns. This statistical baseline is then processed by Gemini 2.5 Flash to provide a daily "Chef's Command" with an associated Waste Risk Score based on data volatility.

2. Raw Material Integrity (Inventory)
BiteConnect doesn't just predict what to sell; it audits the pantry to see if you can actually produce it. Our system cross-references AI-predicted quantities with raw ingredient levels (flour, butter, yeast, etc.) to trigger instant restock alerts for items about to run out.

3. Social Impact Hub (Redistribution)
Despite optimal planning, unavoidable surplus occurs. BiteConnect automatically matches end-of-day leftovers with the nearest verified NGOs and orphanages, automating the logistics of food donation and ensuring nothing goes to waste.
